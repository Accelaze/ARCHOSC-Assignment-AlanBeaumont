    <h1>My name is: Student</h1>

    <p>Upon taking a screenshot of the path and content within my ‘ArchOSC Assignment’,I then pasted 
        the screenshot onto the software ‘Paint’ where I cropped it down to rid it of the unnecessary 
        information (the contents of folders and quick access folders on the left of File Explorer) 
        before saving the file under the name ‘Pictures_in_FIle_001’.
    </p>
    
    <p>I then opened the terminal, running the command ‘git init’ to create a repository (empty) 
        with in a folder of mine.
    </p>

    <p>
        A repository was created for the empty once created locally within the system’s files.
        <br>
        After attempting to link the local repository with the online one on GitHub, 
        I encountered a fatal error and had to grant access to myself in order to proceed. After 
        doing this, I managed to successfully link the two.
    </p>

    <p>
        Followed instructions and made a website.
        <br>
        After having fixed my initial mistake (I was attempting to save the repository onto the 
        wrong place and so received a fatal error), I was able to not only save my changes, but 
        also commit the changes on to the online repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        Successfully saved and pushed the added times on local the repository to the online repository.
        <br>
        I updated the web page a little, renaming some aspects of it as well as well as changing other elements.
        <br>
        I committed a total of four changes tot the website and the pushed it onto github.
    </p>

        Using the terminal and, as a reasult, git, was incredibly useful as it demonstrating a method of
        working with HTML that can also be used to carry out several commands to help with both Git and Visual Code.
        <br>
        Git would be incredibly useful to the industry as it allows for greater control over projects.
